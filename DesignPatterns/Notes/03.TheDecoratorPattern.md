#### OO Principles:
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. 
	- **NOTE:** Its impossible to make every part of the code follow OCP. Its better to concentrate on those areas that are most likely to change and apply the principles there.

#### The Decorator Pattern:
- **The Decorator Pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing(through runtime wrapping) for extending functionality.
- **NOTE:** Factory and Builder Patterns helps with much better way of creating decorated objects.
- ***Composition*** and ***Delegation*** can often be used to add new behaviour at runtime.
