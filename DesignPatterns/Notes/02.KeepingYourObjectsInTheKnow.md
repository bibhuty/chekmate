#### The Observer Pattern:
- **The Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Publisher + Subscriber = Observer Pattern**
- Interesting aspects that makes observer pattern one of the mostly used pattern is **one to many relationship*** and **loose coupling***.
- **Publishers = Subject**
- **Subscribers = Observers**
- One of the most common way of implementing this pattern revolves around a class design that includes **Subject** and **Observer** interfaces.
- **Publisher Subscriber** pattern although is related but is more complex than the **Observer Pattern**.
- Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimise the interdependency between objects.
- You can push or pull data from the ***Subject*** when using the pattern(pull is considered more correct).

#### OO Principles:
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
