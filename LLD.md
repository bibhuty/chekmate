## ðŸ¤” Self-Review Questions
- [ ] Is the code obvious to a reader? Â 
- [ ] Does it look like I cared enough? Â 
- [ ] Is the code communicating intent clearly? Â 
- [ ] Would another engineer find it easy to change/extend? Â 
- [ ] **Boy Scout Rule:** Did I leave the ground cleaner than I found it? Â 
	- Rename one variable, break one large function, eliminate duplication, simplify one composite condition, etc.

## ðŸ”Ž Attention to Detail (LLD)
- [ ] **Abbreviated error handling** â†’ No empty catches, vague logs, or TODOs. Every error path must define recovery or fail-fast.  
- [ ] **Memory leaks** â†’ All resources (DB connections, sockets, file handles, listeners) are closed or released.  
- [ ] **Race conditions** â†’ Shared state is protected (atomic ops, locks, immutability) to avoid concurrent corruption.  
- [ ] **Inconsistent naming** â†’ One concept = one name across modules. No synonyms (e.g., `customerId` vs `clientId`).
