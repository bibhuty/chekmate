# ü§î Self-Review Questions
- [ ] Is the code obvious to a reader? ¬†
- [ ] Does it look like I cared enough? ¬†
- [ ] Is the code communicating intent clearly? ¬†
- [ ] Would another engineer find it easy to change/extend? ¬†
- [ ] **Boy Scout Rule:** Did I leave the ground cleaner than I found it? ¬†
	- Rename one variable, break one large function, eliminate duplication, simplify one composite condition, etc.

# üîé Attention to Detail (LLD)
- [ ] **Abbreviated error handling** ‚Üí No empty catches, vague logs, or TODOs. Every error path must define recovery or fail-fast.  
- [ ] **Memory leaks** ‚Üí All resources (DB connections, sockets, file handles, listeners) are closed or released.  
- [ ] **Race conditions** ‚Üí Shared state is protected (atomic ops, locks, immutability) to avoid concurrent corruption.  
- [ ] **Inconsistent naming** ‚Üí One concept = one name across modules. No synonyms (e.g., `customerId` vs `clientId`).  

# üìã Naming Checklist (Collected Questions)

## Intention-Revealing
- [ ] Does each name clearly reveal **why it exists, what it does, and how it is used**?
- [ ] Would the name still make sense if comments were stripped out?

## Avoid Disinformation
- [ ] Are misleading names avoided (`accountList` when it‚Äôs not actually a list)?
- [ ] Are small/confusing variations avoided (`custId` vs `customerId`)?

## Meaningful Distinctions
- [ ] Are meaningless distinctions avoided (`Product`, `ProductInfo`, `ProductData`)?
- [ ] Are number-series names avoided (`a1`, `a2`, ‚Ä¶)?
- [ ] Are noise words avoided (`the`, `data`, `info`)?

## Pronounceable & Searchable
- [ ] Are all names pronounceable (`generationTimestamp` not `genymdhms`)?
- [ ] Are names searchable (avoid single-letter names outside tiny local scopes)?
- [ ] Are constants named in `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`?

## Avoid Encodings
- [ ] Is scope/type encoding avoided (`m_dsc`, `phoneString`)?
- [ ] Are interface/implementation names clearly distinguished (`PaymentService` vs `PaymentServiceImpl`)?

## Classes & Methods
- [ ] Do classes use nouns or noun phrases?
- [ ] Do methods use verbs or verb phrases?
- [ ] Are overloaded constructors replaced with descriptive static factory methods?
- [ ] Do methods use clear, unambiguous verbs (`kill`, `abort` instead of slang)?

## Consistency
- [ ] Is one word reserved for one concept only (e.g., choose `fetch` OR `get` OR `retrieve`)?
- [ ] Is the same word avoided for different concepts (don‚Äôt use `add` for both concatenation and collection insertion)?

## Context & Domain
- [ ] Is the right balance struck between **solution domain names** (CS terms) and **problem domain names** (business terms)?
- [ ] Are names placed in proper context (grouped in classes/functions/namespaces)?
- [ ] Is unnecessary context avoided (`addrFirstName` inside `Address` class)?
- [ ] Are abbreviations avoided unless universally understood (`URL`, `HTML`)?

# Clean Code ‚Äì Chapter 3 Checklist (Functions)

> *Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to be written.*

---

## Small!
- [ ] Functions are ‚â§ 20 lines.
- [ ] Blocks within `if` / `else` / `while` are a single line (delegating to another function).
- [ ] Indentation does not exceed 1‚Äì2 levels.

---

## Do One Thing
- [ ] Each function does only one thing.
- [ ] All statements in the body are at the same level of abstraction.
- [ ] Function bodies read like a **table of contents** (TOC).
- [ ] If you can extract a sub-function with a meaningful new name, the original was doing more than one thing.

---

## Switch Statements / Multi-if Chains
- [ ] No repeated `switch` or multi-if chains.
- [ ] Polymorphism or strategy objects bury each case in a low-level class.
- [ ] High-level orchestration remains closed to modification (OCP).

---

## Descriptive Names
- [ ] Functions have descriptive names; longer and explicit is better than short and cryptic.
- [ ] Function names use readable multi-word conventions (camelCase / PascalCase).
- [ ] Prefer a descriptive function name over a descriptive comment.

---

## Function Arguments
- [ ] Niladic (0 args) or Monadic (1 arg) preferred.
- [ ] Dyadic (2 args) allowed only when natural (e.g. `assertExpectedEqualsActual`).
- [ ] Triadic (3 args) are a code smell; refactor if possible.
- [ ] Polyadic (>3 args) forbidden unless justified.
- [ ] Related args are grouped into value objects or classes.
- [ ] Argument lists (rest parameters) are used only when items are treated identically.
- [ ] No **flag arguments** (boolean switches that change behavior).
- [ ] No **output arguments**; functions return values instead.
- [ ] Input arguments are not mutated (unless the function name clearly advertises in-place mutation).

---

## Side Effects
- [ ] No hidden side effects (no unexpected state changes).
- [ ] If mutation is required, it happens only on the owning object and is obvious from the function name.
- [ ] No ‚Äúdouble-take‚Äù code (no surprises that force rereading).

---

## Command‚ÄìQuery Separation
- [ ] Functions either **do something** (command) or **answer something** (query).
- [ ] No mixing of command + query in the same function.

---

## Exceptions
- [ ] Functions do not return error codes (no `if (deletePage(page) == E_OK)`).
- [ ] Error handling is its own concern; a function that handles errors does nothing else.
- [ ] No centralized `ErrorCode` enum (dependency magnet).
- [ ] Domain errors are modeled with typed exceptions (or typed results), not codes.

---

## Temporal Coupling
- [ ] APIs do not require methods to be called in a specific order.
- [ ] If sequencing is needed, enforce it with constructors, factories, or state machines.

---

## Structured Programming
- [ ] Functions and blocks have one entry and one exit.
- [ ] Only one `return`, no `break` / `continue` in loops ‚Äî except in very small functions where multiple exits are clearer.
