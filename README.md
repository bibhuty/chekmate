# ✅ Chekmate
> Your second brain for engineering discipline — structured checklists for **PRs, LLDs, and HLDs** with (soon) local LLM assistance.

## 🚦 Why Chekmate?
Messy code, vague design docs, and inconsistent reviews slow teams down. Most of us *know* the principles (Clean Code, DDIA, Patterns) but forget them under pressure.  
Chekmate turns those principles into **checklists you can actually apply** during PRs and design reviews.

## 📋 What’s Inside
- **LLD.md** — Low-level design checklist (naming, functions, classes, formatting, error handling, tests, etc.)
- **HLD.md** *(coming soon)* — High-level design checklist for architecture & systems
- **Principles.md** — Core philosophies distilled from Clean Code & Design Patterns

## 🛠️ Current Usage
Chekmate is a **manual reference** right now:
1. Copy a checklist into your PR or design doc.
2. Walk through the items (or point an LLM at the checklist to assist).

## 🔮 Roadmap
- [ ] Local LLM reviews for PRs & docs against checklists
- [ ] GitHub Action / GHCS bot for inline feedback
- [ ] MCP server for editor/IDE integration
- [ ] Expand HLD templates (system design reviews)

## 📚 Inspiration
