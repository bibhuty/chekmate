#### Introduction:
- Comments are, at best, a necessary evil. If our programming languages were expressive enough, or if we had the talent to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we would not need comments very much -- perhaps not at all.
- The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.
- Clear and expressive code with fewer comments is far more superior to cluttered and complex code with lot of comments
#### Good Comments:
> The only truly good comment is the comment you found a way not to write

- **Legal Comments:** They are usually good but preferred to be in contracts or legal tomes.
- **Informative Comments:** 
  ```ts
// format matched kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy
let timeMatcher:Pattern = Pattern.compile(...);
  ```
- **Explanation of Intent:** 
  ```ts
// Intentionally using Promise.all to reproduce a race condition between tasks
await Promise.all([dummyTask("A"), dummyTask("B"), ....]);
  ```
- **Clarification:**
  ```ts
// [] is truthy in JS, so `if ([])` will always run
if ([]) console.log("This always runs");

// NaN is never equal to itself, so `NaN === NaN` is false
console.log(NaN === NaN); // false

// typeof null is "object" due to legacy quirk
console.log(typeof null); // "object"

// [] == ![] is true because of coercion rules (0 == 0)
console.log([] == ![]); // true
  ```
- **Warning of Consequence:**
  ```ts
// WARNING: Directly mutating globalThis for test isolation; do not do this in real code
globalThis.__TEST_ONLY__ = true;
  ```
- **TODO Comments:**
```ts
// TODO: Replace hardcoded user ID with dynamic lookup
const userId = 123;
```
- **Amplification:**
  ```ts
// IMPORTANT: Always lowercase before comparing to ensure case-insensitive search
const found = items.filter(i => i.toLowerCase() === query.toLowerCase());
  ```
- **Document public APIs with clear, structured comments (JSDoc/TSDoc), not private helpers.**
  ```ts
/**
 * Returns a user profile with enriched data.
 *
 * @param userId - The unique identifier of the user
 * @returns A Promise resolving to the full profile object
 */
async function getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> {
  // private helpers below don’t need full JSDoc
  return fetchProfile(userId);
}
  ```

#### Bad Comments:
- **Mumbling:** Intent is unclear
  ```ts
try {
  riskyOperation();
} catch (err) {
  // uh, handle error somehow
  console.error(err);
}
  ```
- **Redundant Comments:** It doesn't give more information than code
  ```ts
// increment i by 1
i = i + 1;
  ```
- **Misleading Comments:**
  ```ts
// Caches the user for 24 hours
function getUser(id: string): User {
  // actually caches for 12 hours now, but comment wasn’t updated
  return cache.fetch(id, { ttl: 60 * 60 * 12 });
}
  ```
- **Mandated Comments:** It is just plain silly to have a rule that says that every function must have a documentation, or every variable have a comment. Comments like this clutter the code, propagate lies, and lend to general confusion and disorganisation.
  ```ts
/**
 * Adds two numbers together
 *
 * @param {number} a - a number
 * @param {number} b - another number
 * @returns {number} the sum
 */
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
  ```
- **Noise Comments:** Sometimes we see comments that are nothing but noise. They restate the obvious and provide no new info. Refer the above example.
  ```ts
try {
  connectToDb();
} catch (e) {
  // Seriously? Again?!
  throw e;
}
  ```
- **Journal Comments:** Was useful when version control didn't exist. Now its unnecessary and redundant.
- **Avoid comment that can be converted to function or variables**
  ```ts
// Check to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits
if((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && employee.age>65)

/* can be replaced with */
if(employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())
  ```
- **Position Markers:** There are rare case when it makes sense to gather certain functions together beneath a banner like this. But in general they are clutter that should be eliminated-- especially the noisy train of slashes at the end.
  ```ts
  ////// Actions ////////////////////	  
  ```
- **Closing Brace Comments:** It might make sense for long functions with deeply nested structures, it serves only to clutter the kind of small and encapsulated functions that we prefer. So if you find yourself to mark your closing braces, try to shorten your function instead.
  ```ts
if (user.isAdmin) {
  doAdminStuff();
} // end if
  ```
- **Attribution and Bylines:**
  ```ts
  /* Added by Bibhuti */
  ```
- **Commented-Out Code:** It used to be necessary in absence of version control system. Not anymore.
  ```ts
// Deprecated API call – don’t use
// fetchDataFromServer(url).then(handleResponse);

fetchData(url).then(handleResponse);
  ```
- **HTML Comments:** Its an abomination. If comments are going to be extracted by some tool to appear in a Web page, then it should be the responsibility of that tool, and not the programmer, to adorn the comments with appropriate HTML.
  ```ts
/**
 * <p><b>Calculates total price.</b></p>
 * <br>
 * @param price - <i>Base price</i>
 * @param tax - <i>Tax percentage</i>
 * @returns <p>Total including tax</p>
 */
function calculateTotal(price: number, tax: number): number {
  return price + (price * tax);
}
  ```
- **Nonlocal Information:** If you must write a comment, then make sure it describes the code it appears near.
  ```ts
/**
 * Parses the config file.
 *
 * NOTE: The format of this file is defined in the ConfigSpec.docx
 *       stored in \\SharedDrive\OldTeam\Specs (last updated 2019).
 */
function parseConfig(path: string): Config {
  // ...
}
  ```
- **Too Much Information:**
- **Inobvious Connections:** Its a pity when a comment need its own explanation
  ```ts
// Handles special case for legacy users
const regex = /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/;
  ```
- **Function Headers:**
  ```ts
/**
 * Function: add
 * --------------
 * This function adds two numbers and returns the result.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   a - the first number
 *   b - the second number
 *
 * Returns:
 *   The sum of the two numbers
 */
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
  ```
- **tsDoc for Nonpublic Code:** Adding simple comments in tricky code helps that's meant for internal consumption.
