# 📘 Clean Code — Chapter 1 Notes

---
## 🌟 Principles

- **Code as Requirements**  
  - Code = details of requirements that cannot be ignored.  
  - When requirements are specified crisply enough that a machine can execute them → that specification *is code*.  
  - Well-specified requirements can serve as executable tests.  

- **Total Cost of Owning a Mess**  
  - As messy code accumulates, long-term productivity of the team → approaches zero.  
  - The “Grand Redesign in the Sky” usually happens too late and in parallel with feature work → leading to waste.  

- **Professional Attitude**  
  - It is our job to defend code quality with passion.  
  - Like a doctor washing hands before surgery, we must not skip clean practices just because management pressures for speed.  

- **Core Problem: Tight Deadlines**  
  - The only way to go fast is to keep code clean at all times.  
  - Messy code never helps deadlines — it slows everything down.  

- **The Art of Clean Code**  
  - **Code Sense**: not just recognising messy code, but knowing how to clean it.  
  - Clean code is **focused**: each function, class, and module has a **single purpose**, unpolluted by distractions.  
  - Clean code is **decisive**: contains only what is necessary; speculative/generalised code is avoided.  
  - Clean code is **easy to change**: not just readable, but designed for enhancement.  
  - Clean code **shows care**: there is nothing obvious left to improve; it looks intentional.  
  - Clean code reflects the programmer, not the language — clarity comes from discipline, not syntax. 
  - Because we read more than we write (≈10:1), code that is easy to read is also easy to write.
